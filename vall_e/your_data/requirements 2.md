# Setup:

I would like you to get this python script working:

https://github.com/enhuiz/vall-e

There you will be able to follow the steps to train the model and create the output.


# Goals:

Get the repo running on that VM. This means you can train the data on the test dataset they have provided and return an output file.

Use `daniel.wav` and `daniel.normalized.txt` to train a new model on my voice data. Then, output an audio file that says the following text in my voice:

"I am 22 years old. I speak English and Spanish."
